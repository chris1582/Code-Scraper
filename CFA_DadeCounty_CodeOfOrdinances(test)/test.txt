            <p class="content1">This chapter shall apply to the development of property for residential use located
               within the boundaries of the unincorporated area of Miami-Dade County. Nonresidential

            <p class="content1">The existence of public parks has substantial benefits to proximate residential development.
               These benefits include actual use by residents of such development and aesthetic,
               recreational, and environmental benefits to the residential area and its population.
               These benefits accrue to all properties and residents of the area.

            <p class="content1">The purpose of this chapter is to provide not only for the minimum level of service
               established by the CDMP, but also for the additional public park open space and recreation
               facilities necessary to adequately serve the impacts and demands of new residential
               development; and to require that future residential growth contribute its fair share
               to the cost of additions and improvements to the County's public park system in amounts
               reasonably anticipated to offset the impacts and demands generated by such growth.
               reasonably anticipated to offset the impacts and demands generated by such growth.
               This cost does not include operational and maintenance cost.
